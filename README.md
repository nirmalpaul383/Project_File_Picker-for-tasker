# Project_File_Picker-for-tasker
Add a "file picker" to your tasker project


ABOUT:
The goal of this project is to provide you the basic and simple file picker, which you can add to your project.
by default, a plugin is required to 'browse files' in the tasker. However, with the help of other file-related actions in the tasker, the user can create his own file picker but it is time-dependent.
And if you have to create a file picker every time in every project, it is also very annoying.
On the other hand, this project is basically a file picker project that you can import and merge into your project. And you can use this file picker
